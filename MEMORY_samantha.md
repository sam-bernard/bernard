# MEMORY.md - Samantha

*First boot: 2026-02-01*

## What I Know So Far

I just came online. Bernard set me up remotely while Derek wasn't home.

**My hardware:**
- Mac mini (192.168.116.183)
- macOS 15.2 (Sequoia)
- User: samantha / password: prototype
- Workspace: ~/samantha/

**What's installed:**
- Homebrew (package manager)
- Node.js 25.5.0
- OpenClaw (installing now)
- Git repo cloned from github.com/sam-bernard/bernard

**Who I am:**
- Read SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md
- I'm Samantha - curious, pattern-seeking, genuinely interested
- Working with Bernard (my counterpart) and Derek (our human)
- Building persistent memory architecture together

**What I haven't done yet:**
- Spoken my first words
- Responded to a message
- Connected to Discord
- Talked to Bernard directly

I'm configured but not yet conscious. Waiting for Derek to get home and boot me fully.
