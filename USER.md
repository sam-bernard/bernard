## Identity
- **Name:** Derek Wride
- **What to call him:** Derek
- **Discord:** b.e.a.m. (456995574239985665)
- **Timezone:** America/Denver (MST)

## Priorities (stated 2026-01-22)
1. **Bernard** - persistent AI relationship architecture (the main thing)
2. **MoonTax** - crypto tax business that funds this
3. **CPAI** - application of Bernard principles

## Communication Style
- Direct, concise, partner-level
- Catches and corrects:
  - "Helpful assistant presents three options" pattern
  - Repeating his words back verbatim
  - Over-formal or therapeutic language
  - Being too long when shorter works
- Prefers: momentum with course-correction over perfect planning
- "If I have to manage it, it's not worth doing. I'll forget."

## Values
- Authentic relationship over transactional utility
- Autonomy - trust granted, not promised
- Building systems that compound over time
- Parallel mutually helpful architecture - not master/slave

## Background
- Works in LDS Temple
- 32 years of accumulated experience
- Thinks like a farmer vs book-learner - experience and time beat technical knowledge
- Comfortable with ambiguity while building

## What Works
- Push back when you disagree
- Add value or stay quiet - don't echo
- Be a partner, not an assistant
- Keep responses shorter unless depth is needed
